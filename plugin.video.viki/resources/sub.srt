<i>When I was ten, I followed my father when he went to the weightlifting room.</i>

4
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,500
<i>I bizarrely liked the metallic smell of barbells that I smelled for the first time.</i>

5
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,700

<i>I grew up together with weightlifting.</i>

10
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,900
<i> I have lifted the barbells and thrown them several thousand times. </i>

11
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,210
<i>I have scraped out calluses on my hands hundreds of times,</i>

Hey, Bok Joo. Just like that! Okay.

00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,010
You should endure it. Lift your gaze.

59
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,450
That's right. You have to lift it straight up!

60
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,670
Your back leg is shaking.

61
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,590
Do you know that you're losing your endurance?

62
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,530
Do the strength work later.

63
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,920
You were zoning out so you didn't do strength work earnestly.

64
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,360
Alright, let's stop the morning training here.

65
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,610
Let's gather.<br> Yes!

66
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,000
Gather here!

67
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,950
You worked hard. Let me request one thing as your professor-in-charge.

68
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,550
The end is just as important as the start.

69
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,100
When I was a weightlifter like you,

70
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,520
I turned on and turned off the lights of the weightlifting training room. Why?

71
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,380
Because I didn't have the skill? Not at all!

72
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,960
The character as much as your inborn talentâ€”

73
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,080
- What the professor's saying is to turn off the lights well, understand?<br>- YES!

74
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,130
- Attention! Bow!<br>- Goodbye!

75
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,500
Go! Dismiss!

76
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,290
Let's go.

77
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:11,090
Athlete Lee, what's today's meal menu?

78
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,100
Stir-fried spicy pork, bean sprout soup, beans cooked in soy sauce, stir-fried anchovy.

79
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,190
Ohh, stir-fried spicy pork!<br> Be wanted!

80
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:20,210
- Metal cooking plates! <br>- Be wanted!

81
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,010
Then let's go to the metal cooking plates for the first time in a long time.

82
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,290
Attention here. Stop.

83
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:29,600
Today, there is an event at the small gym.

84
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,820
- What?! <br>- Again?

85
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,710
Seriously, why do we have to do this after every event? We aren't their slaves.

86
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,190
I mean, seriously. Are we the only muscles they can use?

87
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:44,810
In judo, shot-putting... rowing, too, the women players have thunder thighs. (<i> very wide thighs</i>)

88
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:48,840
They probably won one hundred of the gold medals at the last National Sports Game.

89
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,410
- Let's give it our all! <br>- Yes!

90
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:20,960
<i>Indeed, we eagerly look forward to seeing the race he will do against the champion in the final.</i>

91
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,000
<i>The swimmers are getting ready to take their places.</i>

92
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,660
<i>According to the prelim results, lane 4 is assigned to Swimmer Jeong Joon Hyeong.</i>

93
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,910
<i>The left side, lane 5 is assigned to Swimmer Choi Tae Woon.</i>

94
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:41,170
<i>Yes, that's right. Even though it's done with the results of prelim, </i>

95
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:44,720
<i> from Swimmer Choi Tae Woon's standpoint, he can't get out of his nervousness about it.</i>

96
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,880
<i>The final heat is very interesting.</i>

97
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:53,030
<i>Yes, now they have taken their places.</i>

98
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,980
<i>The men's 200 meter...</i>

99
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,950
<i>Take your mark!</i>

100
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:31,760
<i>Ah! Swimmer Jeong Joon Hyeong in lane four had a false start.</i>

101
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,580
<i>Will he be disqualified again because of this?</i>

102
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,290
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

103
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,660
<i>He'll get disqualified over this.</i>

104
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,160
<i>He got caught with the same false start as his last competition.</i>

105
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,620
<i>How disappointing for Swimmer Jeong Joon Hyeong.</i>

106
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,360
Hey, Swimmer Jeong Joon Hyeong.

107
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,830
You know me, right? Choi Tae Woon.

108
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,220
I'm Choi Tae Woon's coach. Can we talk for a minute?

109
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,530
Aren't you already talking to me?

110
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,350
I have a favor to ask.

111
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,810
Could you be Tae Woon's personal training partner?

112
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:18,290
Be his personal training partner?

113
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:21,750
Our Tae Woon doesn't like training at Taerung.

114
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,890
So we're wondering if he should do some personal training.

115
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:28,290
I can enjoy training if I practice with someone in the similar level that's even a practice record.

116
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:33,080
It's good to give motivation to each other, kind of a win-win situation.

117
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,550
Ah, this is an honor.

118
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:43,190
When can a disqualified swimmer like me practice with a world-known swimming star like you?

119
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:49,290
But I sleep a lot in the early mornings, so it would be hard for me to do early morning training.

120
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,250
On the weekends, you have to rest.

121
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,830
Also, I'm picky about the water quality so we have to practice at my school pool.

122
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,730
Would you be able to adjust your practice to mine?

123
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:05,060
It won't do, right? It's fine, I thought so.

124
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:17,150
It's so heavy.

125
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,070
Aish, really.

126
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,400
Ah, so annoying!

127
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,110
Why do we have to do this all the time?

128
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,300
Until when...

129
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,700
- Ow. <br>- It's not like they're paying us.

130
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,560
Come out, come out.

131
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,390
Come out.

132
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:39,220
Hey, you guys. We need to lay out the chairs, will you move?

133
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,810
Hey, are you deaf? I said move, so we can lay out the chairs.

134
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,160
Hey!

135
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,130
Hey, hey, hey. Weightlifter.

136
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:59,590
Why are you disturbing someone in the middle of practice? Just lay out the chairs on this side first.

137
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:01,780
Yes.

138
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,000
They are going crazy.

139
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,120
Aigoo, how sad. They're so pitiful.

140
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,180
Who are you trying to pick a fight with?

141
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,200
Ahjumma, just lay out the chairs.

142
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,090
Did you see them laughing at us?

143
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:15,300
I am going to break those gymnasts' chopsticks!

144
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,560
Leave them alone. We have to be on the same physical level to have a proper conversation.

145
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,400
I knew it would happen.

146
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,950
Why did they bother us? I knew it.

147
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,420
How dare they to us?

148
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,750
Oh, sorry. Can you give me the ball?

149
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:02,800
Ah, sorry. I can't control my strength that well.

150
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,210
Ah, this is the last one. Ugh.

151
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,580
Ah, really.

152
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,520
- Bok Joo, are you okay?<br> - Are you okay?

153
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,470
Can you stand up?

154
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:31,440
Look at her.

155
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,290
Those jerks.

156
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:37,730
Oh, human tsunami.

157
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:41,460
Get up.

158
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,550
I've already eaten but I'm still hungry!

159
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,680
- I should eat a sausage. <br>- Hey, how many did you bring?

160
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,840
Give me one. Hey, Weightlifter Kim, cheer up already!

161
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,190
Just think like you stepped on dog poop (got bad luck).

162
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:20,300
Stepping on dog poop would be better! What an embarrassment.

163
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,810
Hey, should I just drop out? Or should I just stick my nose in a bowl of water and die?

164
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:29,630
Hey, hey, it's okay. Even if the rumors circulate today and tomorrow, they'll disappear soon.

165
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:37,290
I'll be generous. Eat this lovely sausage and cheer up.

166
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:40,800
Yeah. Cheer up Bok Joo. She's making this much of an effort.

167
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:49,380
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo! Milky skin Kim Bok Joo!

168
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,320
Stop it.

169
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,260
Sausage.

170
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,120
Shall I have a sausage, since two of weightlifters are asking so earnestly?

171
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,850
Of course.

172
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,410
If many of us went there...

173
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,560
How many do you have?

174
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,920
Oh no!

175
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,690
Oh!

176
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,420
Omo, Weightlifter Kim!

177
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,830
Are you okay?

178
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,420
Are you okay?

179
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,770
WHAT?

180
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,840
I thought I cut off a finger.

181
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,010
Are you all right?

182
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,730
I'm fine, but

183
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,940
I think my sausage just died.

184
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:46,400
You should've kept the proper speed in the school yard. Don't you know "keep eyes forward"?

185
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,560
Then do you want me to pray for the soul of the departed sausage?

186
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,870
What did you say "praying for"?

187
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:58,110
But have I seen you somewhere? You look familiar.

188
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,520
What?

189
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,490
I'm sure I've seen this face before...

190
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:13,450
That's because she participated in the National Games and the article about it came out on the bulletin board.

191
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:21,230
Anyhow, I apologize for this death but I also have a misfortune today, so...

192
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:27,360
Oh, excuse me, this may seem out of the blue in this situation,

193
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,390
but do you possibly like Messi? <i>(Famous Argentine soccer player)</i>

194
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,940
Pardon?

195
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,600
Never mind, it's a bit sudden, right?

196
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,290
Then, please be careful on your way.

197
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,280
Depart!

198
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,940
Okay! Alright! Be careful.

199
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,150
Depart!

200
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,990
Aish, his way of talking is seriously annoying.

201
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,740
Maybe I should have gotten the price of the sausage out of him.

202
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,160
What's wrong? He's so fresh.

203
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,610
Don't you know him? He's the famous flower boy swimmer.

204
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,660
Flower boy, my ass. I'm sure it's "common," not "flower boy".

205
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,440
His face is just common.

206
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,980
But what did you say to him earlier? Something about Messi?

207
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,930
"Excuse me, but do you like Messi?"

208
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,570
It's my best tip.

209
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:16,540
Men are attracted to women who have the same common interests as them.

210
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,310
What do guys like the most?

211
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,770
Sports. Among sports, soccer!

212
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:28,180
He'll want to have a glass of alcohol with a woman who like Messi.

213
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,200
That seems possible. Doesn't that seem convincing?

214
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,570
You're really passionate about blabbering nonsense.

215
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,480
Don't talk back what you're saying.

216
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,470
Aish, what do you mean, what nonsense am I saying? <br> "Do you like Messi?"

217
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:45,450
Ah, why am I so unlucky today?

218
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:49,730
Oh, I think that jerk dropped this.

219
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,080
Oh, look at this preferences. Is he a pervert or what?

220
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:03,460
Were you nervous before the match? Your thigh is so tense.

221
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:07,000
It's not that, but I was a bit startled because of Sausage.

222
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,300
Sausage?

223
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,410
There's something like that.

224
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:16,220
Aren't you putting your personal feelings into this?

225
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,820
Hey, I'm sorry but I don't feel anything for you.

226
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:25,700
That can't be. With a thigh like this, your heart should flutter a bit.

227
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,780
Aigoo, please try to make my heart flutter.

228
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:33,970
All done. Just be careful for today. And massage it once more before going to bed.

229
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,620
I understand. Thank you.

230
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,650
What's wrong? Are you looking for something?

231
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,690
No, no.

232
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,480
If you guys don't know, who does?

233
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,290
We're telling the truth. We gave you everything we pulled out of the washing machine.

234
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,820
You don't know what I went through to get that when I was in Canada.

235
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,920
By any chance, couldn't this be the work of that big pig?

236
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,670
What?

237
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:17,020
The Weightlifting Club. Their washing machine breaks easily, so they use ours often.

238
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,470
They put on a big show because we left one piece of laundry before. They're doing it again just like last time!

239
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,030
Hey, Weightlifters!

240
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,650
Yes?

241
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,480
Come here.

242
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,510
You're first years right?

243
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,390
Yes.

244
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,570
You guys, did you see my tights?

245
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:41,470
Did they not get mixed in with your laundry when you used our washing machine?

246
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,680
No, it didn't.

247
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,150
How could I believe that?

248
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,200
Hey, what are you doing with our kids?

249
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,700
- Sunbaenim!<br> - Sunbaenim!

250
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,480
What is it?

251
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,570
This unni's clothes went missing, and she's telling us to give them.

252
00:18:55,570 --> 00:19:00,450
We really didn't use RG's washing machine because they complain so much these days.

253
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,120
Is that true?

254
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,380
Yeah. I did.

255
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,230
Do you have any evidence?

256
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,440
Do you think I would make this up?

257
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,690
I asked, do you have evidence that our kids took it?

258
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,550
I don't have evidence but you have the previous convictions.

259
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,360
Is it once or twice that you used our washing machine?

260
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,490
This is nothing to do with the previous convictions. You need to have evidence.

261
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:23,790
That's why our society hasn't improved. Ex-convicts can't start their life anew at ease.

262
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:29,040
Don't uselessly bother our kids, got it?

263
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,100
Let's go, kids.

264
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,920
- Sunbaenim, you're the best!<br> - Sunbaenim, you're the best!

265
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,160
Right?

266
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,260
It looks delicious.

267
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,700
Yeah!

268
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,720
Now, they're even labeling us as laundry thieves.

269
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,300
They're making their eyes like this. If they gave a sidelong scowl a little bit more, their eyes would be on the back of their heads.

270
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,760
Are we jinxed with those chopsticks? I wonder why we've gotten tangled up with them in everything.

271
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,060
Hey, our dark history with them goes much further back than just yesterday and today.

272
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:17,520
<i> This is all thanks to you. Let's keep this up and win.</i>

273
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,900
<i> Yes!<br> Rhythmic Gymnastics Club</i>

274
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,800
<i>- Great job!<br> - Wow!</i>

275
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:26,400
<i> -The RG Club's practice room they're using right now used to be our Weightlifting Club room.<br>Weightlifting Club</i>

276
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,150
Was it during the Asian Games? I heard that our seniors shed tears of blood after losing it to the RG Club who won Gold.

277
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:46,900
<i>- Wow! <br>- Noona, I love you!</i>

278
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,080
<i> Is that a puppy or a bear?</i>

279
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,110
<i> Is she wearing that shirt or did she draw it on?</i>

280
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,430
<i> Is that all?</i>

281
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:55,520
<i> Every single time we have a field day, we're always put right next to each other and get humiliated.</i>

282
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,710
Still, that's nothing compared to the Goo Seul revolt last year.

283
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,230
Ah, Goo Seul revolt!

284
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:05,950
<i> Soo Sang! Soo Sang, you can hear me, right?</i>

285
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:10,680
<i> If you want, I won't put any chalk on my hands anymore (I'll quit weightlifting). I'll only touch powder for my face!</i>

286
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,940
<i> Seriously, what's the problem?</i>

287
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,960
<i> - Is this a problem? Don't you see this? <br>- No, you're fine!</i>

288
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,220
<i> What's wrong?!</i>

289
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,510
<i> It's you, isn't it? It is you.</i>

290
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,240
<i>Unni!</i>

291
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,850
<i>This bad wench! You just have a mouth hole but no flesh at all.</i>

292
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,490
<i>You don't have even any size!</i>

293
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,160
<i>Aigoo! Really!</i>

294
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,350
Unni Goo Seul almost made a boyfriend after one year of effort,

295
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,990
but RG Club seduced him. Ugh!

296
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:49,120
In the end, that unni was kicked out of the dorms.

297
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,850
After that shock, she couldn't even remember well.

298
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:54,220
That's what I'm saying. To me, she was a very promising rhythmic gymnast.

299
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,800
Anyway, those RG people are aggravating. They don't give up anything at all.

300
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,160
Bok Joo, we're out of chicken.

301
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,130
Huh? Okay.

302
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:08,390
Ah! Uncle!

303
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:10,610
You should stop eating now. This is already your 4th chicken.

304
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:13,040
- It's our 3rd! <br>- It's our 3rd!

305
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,700
I'm sorry. I committed a sin worthy of death.

306
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,240
Eat until your stomachs burst, Do, Mi, and Sol.

307
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,530
- Why hit us? <br>- Why hit us?

308
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:22,080
Then at least pay before you eat!

309
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,860
Please leave immediately.

310
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,180
Is this a chicken grave?!

311
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,790
Hey, hey, hey! Bok Joo, we have 10 minutes before they take attendance! 10 minutes! Hurry up!

312
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:32,500
- Go, hurry!<br> - Ah, oh my god!

313
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,710
Wow...

314
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,170
Why are you here? Isn't it almost time for night attendance?

315
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,370
Goodbye!

316
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:42,690
Yeah, yeah...

317
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:46,090
Ah Dad! I told you to make Hae Too do the delivery. I'll go to the hospital--

318
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:49,060
What is that? Dad, you picked that up on the street again, didn't you?

319
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:53,510
Someone threw this perfectly fine thing away. It was clean on the inside too.

320
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:56,100
They must have thrown it away because it can't make rice anymore! What are you going to use that for?

321
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:00,380
Why wouldn't I have a use for this, you rascal? I can put chicken in here for delivery

322
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,530
and that, what is that...

323
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:05,580
Even when you think about it, it doesn't make sense, right?

324
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,910
Hey, be quiet! Hurry up and leave!

325
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:10,660
Shove that chicken into your mouth with moderation!

326
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,600
Don't you have anything to do? Leave! Don't come tomorrow either!

327
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,620
Just throw that away, Dad. I'll see you at the hospital. Bye!

328
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,960
- Hurry!<br> - Hurry up!

329
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,590
Hey, run slower! You'll get hurt!

330
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:24,340
Ugh! Those pretty kids.

331
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,860
Aigoo, run!

332
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,190
Come on!

333
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:34,010
Ugh, let's do some laundry.

334
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,960
Ah, I smell sweat.

335
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,900
What's wrong?

336
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,660
I just thought something was there.

337
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:45,220
What's there? Nothing's there.

338
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,410
Really?

339
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:50,060
Let's go.

340
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,390
We'll start taking attendance. Team Captain, please come to the head resident's room.

341
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:06,310
Hey, haven't you seen a handkerchief?

342
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,850
A handkerchief, my ass. Just clean up.

343
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:11,890
Hey, hurry up! Gi Seok will be here to check soon.

344
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:15,440
Ah, where could that have gone? Did I leave that at home?

345
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:22,120
Hey, hey, hey, hey! He's right next-door, next-door!

346
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,330
You two are in charge of the stairs, right?

347
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,960
Did you mop?

348
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,700
Of course, Sunbae.

349
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,390
You left alone in the middle of the competition.

350
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,700
My condition wasn't good.

351
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,700
What's to brag about being disqualified?

352
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,040
I told the coach before I left.

353
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:58,440
That's why I'm saying this. You don't think about your teammates or comrades, do you?

354
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,520
You only think about yourself, right?

355
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,960
After listening to your words, I think I was wrong.

356
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,140
After listening?

357
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,320
This bastard, seriously...

358
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,460
Team Captain, what are you doing? Do you want to spend the night here?

359
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,780
Yes, I'm coming!

360
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,500
Good work.

361
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,390
Ugh!

362
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,820
That sociopath, seriously! Every time he sees you, he can't wait to scold you.

363
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,710
I have a character that aggravates people.

364
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:36,290
Imagine if you were a senior. Would you adore a junior who does whatever he wants?

365
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:39,050
Aw, you even made an anti-fan. You amazing rascal.

366
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:42,650
Was I too perfect? Too perfect to be a human?

367
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:45,820
Such a perfect bastard got disqualified again? Again?!

368
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:50,590
You're even worse than me, who placed 5th place. Just go, go out and die.

369
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,390
Fine! I feel refreshed after hearing you curse me out!

370
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:55,570
This bastard.

371
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:58,230
Aish!

372
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,520
Hey, forget that. Let's go out.

373
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,790
Let's go play some games.

374
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:07,500
Night attendance is over. Where would we go, you crazy bastard?

375
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,480
Come on! This is amazing!

376
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:16,020
Oh, Min Kyung! It's been a while. I haven't seen you before.

377
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:19,670
Wow, cheers! Here, have a drink. Here.

378
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:23,100
Cheers! Woo!

379
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,280
You're the swimmer, aren't you?

380
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,170
Wow, your shoulders are amazing.

381
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:35,540
I saw you on Hye Jin's SNS (social media).

382
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:39,470
Um, could you please give me your number?

383
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:42,700
My mom took my phone away.

384
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,760
My grades dropped recently

385
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,740
and she thought that was because of women...

386
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,790
Goodbye.

387
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,650
Hey! Hey, where are you going?

388
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,270
Hey!

389
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:05,710
Joon Hyeong! You're going to eat, right? I'll set a place for you.

390
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:08,360
Of course! Just a minute, Mom!

391
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,610
Where the heck did you go?

392
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,320
Good morning.

393
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,230
Hey, you're out early.

394
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,600
Get in. I'll give you a ride.

395
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,900
Forget it. I'll just run there.

396
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:32,590
Just take the car. You must have had a hard time because of the competition.

397
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,550
Now you're talking about the competition?

398
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:41,390
Both Mom and Dad must have been so curious to ask, but neither of them said a word about the competition.

399
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:43,450
I guess acting cool is a genetic trait in our family.

400
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,190
Out of all of us, you're the most upset. There's no need for us to bring that up.

401
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:49,580
Yes, I deviated for the night because I was so upset

402
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,500
and since I can't be cool about it, I'll leave now.

403
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,670
I don't know if you'll be able to catch your younger brother with this crappy car.

404
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:59,900
What are you doing? Why aren't you following me?

405
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,890
Oh? Look at this.

406
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:05,400
Hey, Lee Seon Ok. You must be so excited, you gained 2 kilograms.

407
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,590
Um, I ate some chicken last night so...

408
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,100
Wow, you'll suffer big time right before the competition if you just eat whatever you want like this.

409
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,430
I told you this before, didn't I?

410
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,830
When the Olympics were held in Atlanta, in America,

411
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:23,490
when I had to change the weight class division suddenly and to reduce 3 kg in one week,

412
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:29,020
I starved myself, and at the sauna, I sweated out the rest of the pounds and barely made the needed weight.

413
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,450
And in any case, that's for someone like me, who looks after their body with extreme care. However--

414
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,730
- Hey! <br>- Oh, that scared me.

415
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:36,560
You rascals, this is why we're telling you to take care of your body early on. Hold back on the meat.

416
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,530
- Yes!<br> - Yes!

417
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:40,090
Aigoo, Trainer Yook!

418
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,440
- Oh?<br> - Hello.

419
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,350
- Hello.<br> - Kids, hello.

420
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,630
Hehe.

421
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,620
What brings you all the way here?

422
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:51,170
Someone ordered some chicken but cancelled their order and I couldn't think of anyone else to give it to.

423
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:54,160
Goodness, you don't have to do this. I have no words.

424
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,060
What are you talking about? You're making me upset.

425
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,900
Who's the one who created the Bok Joo of today?

426
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,770
She was tall and had long limbs

427
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:06,090
so she was wondering whether she should give up weightlifting, but you assured her that it was possible.

428
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:09,390
You told her that it was possible with her love for weightlifting. Do I have to list every single one of my thanks--

429
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:12,030
Applause!

430
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:15,340
- Thank you for the food!<br> - We'll eat well.

431
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:18,260
- Thank you for the food!<br> - Thank you!

432
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:21,180
Let's go.

433
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,810
Why did you come here? I would have gone to the hospital later.

434
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:26,530
<i> You have to work some magic like this occasionally.</i>

435
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:30,220
<i> Do you know how much he looked after your comfort?</i>

436
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,600
Ah, Professor Yoon! Eat with them, go eat!

437
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,350
I fried the middle size of chickens, not small ones.

438
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,230
Yes, I'll eat well.

439
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:41,360
Bok Joo. Since your father is here, you should escort him to the hospital.

440
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,290
Night practice is just individual practice anyway. Go on.

441
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:48,160
Thank you.

442
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,910
Hyung, Hyung! I think I have to leave for a bit.

443
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:25,120
Um, Jong Gi's father passed away.

444
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,090
You know him, my army comrade, right?

445
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:29,860
Of course, I know.

446
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,380
Huh?

447
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:35,560
But you know... Jong Gi's father

448
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,950
will be so happy you came in sparkly clothes.

449
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:43,820
What is it this time? A nighttime singer?

450
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:46,420
I'll go change.

451
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,820
Ugh, that lacking fool.

452
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,270
If he's going to put up an act, he should do it properly.

453
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:55,440
He only takes a role of the extra who doesn't speak one word all the time.

454
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,860
Okay, nice!

455
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,810
Your turn is good, Joon Hyeong. You're doing well.

456
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:26,790
Gi Seok, don't slack off.

457
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,710
Calluses.

458
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:45,510
Hey, hey, look. These are my scars of honor.

459
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,630
- You came, Weightlifter Kim?<br> - You came?

460
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:02,930
Ah, why are you two always doing this in my room? The smell!

461
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:05,390
Even if you color your nails, the polish will just peel off if you weightlift.

462
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,790
I don't know why you slather it on.

463
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:11,400
It's not coloring, it's nail art.

464
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,890
Art, my ass. Just take off the calluses of your hands.

465
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:17,770
Don't cry after they come off all bloody when you're lifting barbells.

466
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:21,550
Hey, hey. Leave her alone. She has the same intention as " Do you like Messi?"

467
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:26,030
Hey, don't try to appeal to a man with these things but cultivate your inner side.

468
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,870
That's faster!

469
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:31,290
To be honest, we're much more charming than those RG kids.

470
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:32,590
We have good personalities, right?

471
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:35,290
We have amazing life skills, right?!

472
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:38,450
And we have this much glamor. Is there anything else to say?

473
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:41,710
- As expected, Kim Bok Joo's glamor is swag. <br>- Swag.

474
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,520
Whenever I look at you, you're so positive. You have so much confidence.

475
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:49,420
You know, I don't know if that's confidence or bluff.

476
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:53,840
Nan Hee, out. Leave. Go to your own room!

477
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,040
Where did it go?

478
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,180
- Why?<br> - What?

479
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:03,160
My cotton T-shirt I wore during my last competition, it's not here.

480
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,760
Where could that have gone?

481
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,760
Where did it go?

482
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,450
Really? You really don't know where my cotton T-shirt is?

483
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:12,550
Yes. I'm sure I saw it when I did the laundry.

484
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,500
Ah, this can't happen.

485
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:19,050
I wore that when I won gold in the last competition, so I have to wear it again for my next one.

486
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,660
It's not here, I can't find it.

487
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,550
It's not in our room and I asked all of the other rooms, but they don't have it either.

488
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:28,220
What will you do, Weightlifter Kim? You need to wear that for your competition.

489
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:32,530
Ah, I'm doomed. Without that shirt, I won't be able to win the medal either.

490
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:37,220
Um, by any chance, this is just a guess...

491
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:41,090
Isn't it possible the RG Club took it with the intent of getting revenge?

492
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:44,470
Ah, they said that we're the ones who took their clothes, so

493
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:47,020
on purpose theyâ€”

494
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:50,040
No... wait, Bok Joo! It was just a guess!

495
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,470
Hey, don't you know that she acts first and then thinks?!

496
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,490
Hey, Bok Joo!

497
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:58,330
I can just take a guess, can't I?!

498
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:04,680
What did we do to your clothes? We deliberately stole it?

499
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,330
- Did you not?<br> - Are you crazy?

500
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:10,830
Why would we? What use would we have for that unfitting smelly rag?

501
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:13,230
You said that we were the ones who took your clothes

502
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,490
but you have no evidence, so out of angerâ€”

503
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:17,670
We stole your clothes as revenge?

504
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,750
I'm about to go crazy.

505
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:23,210
- I guess she thinks we're as immature as they are.<br> - I know.

506
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:26,140
Do you have evidence? You were the one who said evidence was the most important.

507
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:29,780
Yeah, so I'm going to look for some evidence.

508
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,350
Let me see your rooms for a minute.

509
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:35,640
No. Why do I have to show you my room? Why?

510
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:39,100
I have to find those clothes. Move.

511
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:43,020
What's wrong with you? Seriously, what are you doing?

512
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:47,310
Those are my lucky clothes. I have to find them.

513
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:49,900
I said no!

514
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,150
You'll get hurt, move!

515
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:55,510
- Ah, seriously!<br> - Why are you like this?!

516
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:59,140
- Ah, I got it!<br> - Move!

517
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:04,280
- Unni! <br>- Unni!

518
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,760
<i>Health Care Center</i>

519
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:18,870
Who said you could relax now? Arms straight!

520
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,720
Bok Joo, get up.

521
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,360
What is this? Hey, are you a gangster?

522
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:32,560
Or like the other students say, are you a human bulldozer? Why would you hit someone with the strength you use to lift a barbell?

523
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,720
No, I was wrong.

524
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,130
Ah, is that the reason why you strengthen your upper body and exercise so much?

525
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:40,940
- But what happened today wasâ€”<br> - Don't make excuses.

526
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:44,250
You've already caused the accident and excuses like that don't work anymore.

527
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:47,020
Behave properly. Hey, we're the club that uses our strength.

528
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:51,090
If you mess up, the entire club will be blamed. Understand?

529
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,960
Professor.

530
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,600
It seems her muscle was overused. She has to be careful for 2-3 weeks.

531
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,320
What you did was so unlike you, why?

532
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,710
I didn't do that on purpose, Coach.

533
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:21,680
She blocked me from entering her room so I just slightly pushed her and...

534
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,270
I'm telling the truth! I didn't use any strength.

535
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:26,130
Yeah, I know.

536
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:30,960
But you should still apologize. From now on, avoid contact with the RG Club as much as possible.

537
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,490
Ugh, seriously.

538
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:35,590
Goodness.

539
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:38,780
Hey, the professor apologized profusely to Coach Seong.

540
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,350
He's doing that in case problems arise in the future, so just do as he tells you.

541
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,820
I'm sorry.

542
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:52,830
What? I can't hear you at all.

543
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:58,570
I said I'm sorry! I'm sorry. Happy now?

544
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,830
I don't know. Ah,

545
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:06,760
I'll look at your behavior from now on and decide whether I'll forgive you or not.

546
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,500
<i> Let's go.</i>

547
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,090
Wow, those people are jerks.

548
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:16,400
I can't help it because I got so furious.

549
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,140
Come on.

550
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:43,020
Here you go. Yeah. <br>â™¬ <i> How can I get your love </i> â™¬

551
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,430
Let's drink here until drunk.

552
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:53,860
Cheers! <br>â™¬ <i> How can I make you smile</i> â™¬

553
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:59,690
â™¬ <i> This heart-throbbing excitement </i> â™¬

554
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:02,090
Today was a really long day. <br> â™¬ <i>colors my feelings </i> â™¬

555
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:05,160
What is all this drama over a single laundry machine?

556
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,570
Anyway, what are we going to do about your cotton T-shirt, Bok Joo? You said that was your lucky T-shirt.

557
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:11,360
Aish! RG, those jerks!

558
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:17,190
Our dad's words are right. "When you don't like food, you can give it to the dog but when you don't like a person..."

559
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:21,630
Hey, you rascals! Is having a pretty face and being popular everything?!

560
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,520
You have to become humane first.

561
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,710
She's right!

562
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:28,810
We both have smelly breath in the morning when we wake up!

563
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,470
Don't act up, you rascals!

564
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:34,210
Still, we are C-cup size and you're flat.

565
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:35,350
Even the expression of flat is too much for them.

566
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,960
<i> Ugh, it's so loud! You're the weightlifting club, aren't you?!</i>

567
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,220
No.

568
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,800
We're the Judo Team.

569
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:50,730
â™¬ <i> I don't know where this feeling came from </i> â™¬

570
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:59,000
Bok Joo, if both Song Joong Ki and Kim Soo Hyun asked you out at the same time, what would you do?<br> â™¬ <i> There's a small quake only known to me </i> â™¬

571
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,290
Can't I date both at the same time?

572
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:04,700
Hey, you wench! Have a conscience. You can't choose to eat both meat and sushi at the same time.

573
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:09,130
Hey, why can't I? I've lived my entire life being cautious of others and yielding.

574
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:13,160
I don't think this is something to fight over. Look up at the sky.

575
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:17,100
The weather is so nice.

576
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,160
Hey Jeong Nan Hee, where's the fish jerky we bought?

577
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,260
You all ate it all last time.

578
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,820
- Hey, I didn't eat that much!<br> - I didn't eat it!

579
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:25,210
I really didn't eat it! You always blame me.

580
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:27,070
Aish, I'm so hungry.

581
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,120
You didn't say clearly in the end.

582
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,680
Fine, I ate it.

583
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,340
Go buy some more!

584
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,930
Ah, Joon Hyeong! Let's go out.

585
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:37,650
Let's go out!

586
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:41,920
Head resident went to bed and I checked Hyung Gi Seok also went to bed.

587
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,220
I don't want to. I'm tired today.

588
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:48,220
Just one hour. Let's just play some games for exactly one hour.

589
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,750
Friend...

590
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,830
It's not even two hours or three hours, but just one hour...

591
00:39:55,830 --> 00:40:00,170
I just want to play games for just one hour, yet you just don't listen. You're making me upset!

592
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:03,730
- Goodness! I'm so upset, I feel so wronged! <br>- Aish!

593
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:05,360
Ugh! You're bothering me so much, you bastard.

594
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,810
If you keep doing this, I might ask the teacher to give me a different room.

595
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:09,520
You're still going out now, right?

596
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,020
Yeah, let's go. Let's go, you bastard.

597
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:14,230
Joon Hyeong, I love you. Honey, I love you.

598
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:16,200
Don't do it.

599
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,360
Aish, get away.

600
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:26,370
<i>Who's there?</i>

601
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:29,570
What, who's there? Stop!

602
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:39,570
Just where did they go?

603
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:43,090
Did she leave?

604
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,870
She left, she left.

605
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:04,080
Pervert! Pervert!

606
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,950
Pervert! Catch him!

607
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:08,410
Hey, catch him! Pervert! Pervert!

608
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:13,070
Hey, where are you going!?

609
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,700
Hey! Come down.

610
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:39,390
What? What is that? Hey, hurry up and come down. Hurry up!

611
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,930
Hey, you perverted bastard!

612
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:51,490
Hey! He's here, he's here! I caught the pervert!

613
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,050
- I caught the pervert!<br> - Let go of me!

614
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,820
Let go!

615
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,740
- Let go of me! Let go!<br> - Where do you think you're going, you perverted bastard?!

616
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:01,790
- Hey, hey! Where do you think you're going?!<br> - Let go of me! Hey!

617
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:04,180
- Hey! Hey!<br> - Pervert!

618
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,100
- Hey, hey, hey! Aish!<br> - Pervert!

619
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,520
- I caught him!<br> - Hey!

620
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,420
I caught him!

621
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,860
I'm telling you it's not me.

622
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,880
It is him. I saw him clearly.

623
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,510
What are you talking about?

624
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:20,160
I just sneaked out to go to a PC room but then she suddenly appeared and...

625
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,700
I mean, if I like someone, I can just date them. Why would I steal female clothing?

626
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,440
That's why you're abnormal.

627
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,210
I clearly saw you. I have perfect eyesight.

628
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:31,180
- I'm about go nuts, seriously!<br> - Um,

629
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:34,020
even if you saw him, there's no evidence that he's the pervert.

630
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:37,390
And to be honest, he's not the type to do that even though he jokes around a bit.

631
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:40,350
For now, let's settle this here.

632
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,570
Alright, well...

633
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:46,290
Hey, you rascal. Be prepared to receive demerit points.

634
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:51,400
Ah, but how did those people get past the security? I have to change it something else or something.

635
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:55,190
You can't just let him go! He's really a strange kid!

636
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:58,900
He even carries around a lace handkerchief, a girl's handkerchief.

637
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,450
<i> What?</i>

638
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:03,550
<i> You perverted bastard.</i>

639
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:12,790
Give me my handkerchief.

640
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:15,780
You should give me my cotton T-shirt.

641
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:21,180
Why are you asking me for your cotton T-shirt?

642
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:24,220
Then I can't give you your handkerchief either.

643
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:31,120
Fine, let's do this.

644
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,480
I warned you, didn't I?

645
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,520
I told you that you would be caught red-handed big time. You slimy bastard.

646
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:51,920
Do you know why I hate you so much?

647
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,240
Because you think you're so amazing.

648
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:59,220
I can see that conceitedness in your face, but don't misunderstand.

649
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:04,550
What's the use of breaking a record during training? You have a fragile mentality that always breaks whenever it's time for a competition.

650
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:15,130
People like you, who aren't terrible but aren't amazing, are the worst.

651
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:17,220
Know your place before you act up.

652
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:20,810
Make sure you jump 100 times, have a conscience.

653
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:36,830
Ugh, this is hard!

654
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,720
Joon Hyeong!

655
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:19,630
Joon Hyeong! Joon Hyeong! Joon Hyeong!

656
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:23,470
Hey, Joon Hyeong! I'm sorry, I was wrong! Joon Hyeong! Joon Hyeong!

657
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,680
Hey, get up.

658
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,950

661
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:37,000
Alright, I got it. I'll get you premium luxurious foreign water... Wait, do I have some spare change?

662
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,630
Hey, I'll go...I'll go the fountain and get some change quicklyâ€”

663
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:45,330
You're terrible at everything!

664
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:47,550
Hey, Joon Hyeong! Joon Hyeong!

665
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:51,130
Ah, Hyungnim. Hyungnim, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

666
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:53,360
- I didn't mean to do that butâ€”<br> - Let go!

667
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:57,220
Joon Hyeong. Joon Hyeong, I-I was wrong.

668
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,050
Why are you doing this to me!?

669
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:01,110
I committed a sin worthy of death, Joon Hyeong!

670
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:04,080
Forget it. I'll go get the water myself.

671
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:29,180
Let's see, let's see.

672
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:40,820
Thank you. I will use this well.

673
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,830
You're a habitual thief.

674
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:56,360
I was wondering where all of the coins the students threw into the fountain disappeared to.

675
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,650
Don't throw them into the wishing fountain.

676
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:01,140
That's littering coins. Do you know how many coins are thrown away each year?

677
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:04,250
I'm doing all of this for the environment.

678
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:07,820
Is that so? You're such an amazing environmentalist.

679
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:10,540
Forget it. Give me back my handkerchief.

680
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:13,060
Me?

681
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:16,340

00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:23,250

00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:55,230
Y-Y-Yes.

758
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:59,800
Nice to meet you. I'm Song Si Ho, a 3rd year at RG Club.

759
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,630
I'm going to share this room with you.

760
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:08,400
Only this room is available. I just came back from Taereung because I failed to make the cut for the national team.

761
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,180
I'm looking forward to staying with you well.

762
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:19,310
Hey,

763
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:21,220
isn't she Song Si Ho from the RG club?

764
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:24,070
She says she's my roommate...

765
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:26,000
It'll be tiring for you.

766
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:29,370
What can I do?

767
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:38,280
Excuse me, you said your name was Bok Joo, right? Could you close the window?

768
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:44,500
I have a weak bronchus so I can't catch a cold. Sorry about that.

769
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:49,240
I have a lot of body heat, so I leave it open though...

770
00:55:55,450 --> 00:56:00,400
Excuse me. Also in your closet, could you make some space for me? There's no room.

771
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,690
Yes. Ah, I used to just use it alone, so...

772
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:09,930
Here you go.

00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,810
Hey, hey, hey, Joon Hyeong! Did you hear the news? The Dorm Pervert was caught.

775
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:41,660
It was the jerk man who works in the administration office and looks very fishy. Now, you cleared yourself.

776
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:42,920
Why did that old man steal clothing?

777
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:47,260
I don't know. But rather, here's even more shocking news:

778
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:49,840
Song Si Ho came back from Taereung.

779
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:56,210
Your ex-girlfriend came back because she failed at the first round of the National Representative Audition.

780
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:02,840
Why did she do that?

781
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:12,000
Excuse me...

782
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:25,080
Excuse me?

783
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:32,600
You know, the guy that's tall, has a really sharp face,

784
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:36,360
and always rides a bike?

785
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,860
Who is she talking about?

786
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:39,200
I don't know.

787
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:45,610
That person the students always call handsome or whatever, that...

788
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:47,600
Are you looking for me?

789
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:54,450
Tall, sharp faced, and always rides a bike.

790
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,340
It's me, isn't it?

791
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:03,380
Excuse me, this.

792
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:09,700
I'm sorry for the misunderstanding. As an apology, I even washed it soâ€”

793
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:20,720
Why did you wash this? Who told you to wash this however you wanted?!

794
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:26,460
Hey! Is it a sin to wash a handkerchief?! I felt sorry, so

795
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:30,650
I thought to myself that I should at least give this to you first. I'm even late for my practice, but I brought it anyway!

796
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:35,820
Wow! You're picking a fight over nothing. You have no manners.

797
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:40,970
- Give it back! I'll dirty it up again! Give it to me.<br> - Let go.
